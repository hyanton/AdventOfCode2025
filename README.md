# Advent of Code 2025

We suggest to create for each day two files:
- example.txt
- data.txt

example.txt contains the data of the given example.
data.txt contains the real data on which to run your solution.

Code your solution inside a file, let's call it solve.py and save it in the same place as the two .txt files.

By importing `sys` library and using `sys.stdin` in solve.py you can use the flow to run your algorithm on the inputs.
In your terminal simply run the following command
```console
python solve.py < example.txt
python solve.py < data.txt
```
